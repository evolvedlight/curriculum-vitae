\section{Experience}
\cventry{2019--current}{Dev team Lead, Senior Software Engineer}{Gentwo}{Zurich}{}{Lead Developer at Gentwo. Full stack development from network cables to messaging systems.\newline{}%
As an early employee I took initiative to guide and improve the development team and software.
\newline
Highlights at Gentwo include:%
\begin{itemize}%
\item \textbf{Startup buildout: } As an early employee, I designed and built much of the infrastructure and systems used at Gentwo
\item \textbf{Azure/Managed services:} I consolidated the early technology choices into a single manageable platform, ensuring the whole team could focus on high value work rather than infrastructure maintenance
\item \textbf{Developer onboarding and recruitment}: I setup and organised our recruitment programs to ensure we could build out a high quality team\item \textbf{Developer onboarding and recruitment}: I setup and organised our recruitment programs to ensure we could build out a high quality team
\item \textbf{Team organisation and agility}: As we grew from a single team into two, I helped both teams transition to a stable organised development process
\end{itemize}}
Technologies used: \textbf{C\#, .Net Core, ASP.NET Core, EF Core, Git, RabbitMQ, Vue.js, Kubernetes, Helm}
\newline

\cventry{2017--2019}{Senior Software Engineer Deritrade}{Vontobel}{Zurich}{}{Software Engineer in both the frontend and backend teams within Structured Products. \newline{}%
Project highlights at Vontobel include:%
\begin{itemize}%
\item \textbf{RabbitMQ: } I initiated and completed most of the work to migrate from MSMQ to RabbitMQ. The benefit of this was to increase scalability and enable use of .Net core. Other teams then moved to use this, following my example.
\item \textbf{Kubernetes/Containers:} I initiated the project to start moving onto Linux Containers and Openshift (Kubernetes) for the Structured Products department. The benefit of this was to standardise project architecture, reduce support costs, and improve scalability. This required coordinating between teams, revising technical standards, evangelising various teams, and solving much historical technical and process debt. 
\item \textbf{Support Improvements}: I worked with business and the technology teams to identify areas in which historically the department had continuously spent time manually supporting the Deritrade platform. We reduced the everyday automated problems by at least 50\%, with business changes, technical changes, and process changes between the teams.
\end{itemize}}
Technologies used: \textbf{C\#, .Net Core, ASP.NET Core, EF Core, Git, REST, RabbitMQ, MSMQ, NServiceBus, OpenShift, Docker, Vue.js, gRPC, Swagger}
\newline

\cventry{2015--2017}{Senior C\# programmer}{Quartal}{Zurich}{}{Team Lead, responsible for 6 developers. Worked with management and colleagues to improve efficiency of the team, transforming the team from one that often failed to deliver into a highly performing team.\newline{}%
Project highlights in Quartal include:%
\begin{itemize}%
\item \textbf{Release Automation:} To allow us to release faster and with fewer errors, I took the existing release process and automated most of it into a single click. This replaced the highly manual process that required several team members previously;
\end{itemize}}
Technologies used: \textbf{C\#, SQL/Oracle, Git, WCF, IoC (AutoFac), Teamcity, Visual Studio}
\newline

\cventry{2011--2015}{Programmer (Assistant Vice President)}{Bank of America}{London}{}{Engineer on a critical trading system at Bank of America for Equities. I worked on all parts of the application, spanning from the C\# frontend to the Java backend and release scripts. Responsibilities also included interacting with Markitwire (an automated inter-bank trade settlement system), performing regulatory checks, and communicating with downstream systems. \newline{}%
Project highlights in Bank of America include:%
\begin{itemize}%
\item \textbf{Hot-Hot servers:} To increase availability and speed of our production systems, I implemented a DNS and HTTP based hot-hot load balanced system, one of the first in the bank.
\item \textbf{REST/Swagger:} To allow other teams to benefit from the high performance system we had developed, we opened up our internal APIs using a REST/HTTP interface. I developed a single consistent JSON based REST api which was easy to use and trivial to develop against. This was automatically documented with Swagger.
\end{itemize}}
Technologies used: \textbf{C\#, Python, SQL/Oracle, Ansible, Haproxy, Git, Swagger, REST, Teamcity, NuGet, Kerberos}
\newline

\cventry{Summer 2010}{Google Summer of Code Student}{Google/OpenStreetMap}{UK}{}{I was accepted into Google Summer of Code to work on an open source Android application called OpenSatNav. \newline{}%
Project highlights while working for Google/OpenStreetMap include:%
\begin{itemize}%
\item Significant development on an open source Android application
\item Collaborated with team members and translators around the world
\item Took on responsibility for managing release schedule
\end{itemize}}
Technologies used: \textbf{Java, Android, SVN, OpenStreetMap, Google Play Store, XML, GPS}
