Interests and Skills
--------------------

* I contribute to OpenStreetMap, a type of Wikipedia for maps that is building an open map of the 
entire world. This led me onto the OpenSatNav project (a mobile satnav based upon 
OpenStreetMap), and then the Google Summer of Code job.
* I am an experienced white-water kayaker, and have been leading trips for two years. I was on the 
organising committee of the university club for two years, and drive 17-seater minibuses for the 
university club.
* I have experience in other programming languages outside of work and university including PHP, 
MySQL, MS SQL, VB, ASP, C#, HTML, CSS, and I have good Linux skills.
